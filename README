QXGEdit - Qt XG Editor
----------------------

QXGEdit is a Qt GUI for editing MIDI System Exclusive files
for XG devices (eg. Yamaha DB50XG). 

Website:

  http://qxgedit.sourceforge.net

Project page:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/qxgedit

Weblog:

  http://www.rncbc.org

QXGEdit is free, open-source software, distributed under the terms of
the GNU General Public License (GPL) [3] version 2 or later.


Requirements
------------

The software requirements for build and runtime are listed as follows:

  Mandatory:

  [1] Qt4 (core, gui), C++ class library and tools for
        crossplatform development and internationalization
        http://qt.nokia.com/products/

  [2] ALSA, Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
        http://www.alsa-project.org/


Installation
------------

The installation procedure follows the standard for source distributions.
Unpack the tarball and in the extracted source directory:

    ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
    make

and optionally as root:

    make install

This procedure will end installing the following couple of files:

    ${prefix}/bin/qxgedit
    ${prefix}/share/pixmaps/qxgedit.png
    ${prefix}/share/applications/qxgedit.desktop

Just launch ${prefix}/bin/qxgedit and you're off (hopefully).

Note that the default installation path ${prefix} is /usr/local.

If you're checking out from Subversion (SVN), you'll have to prepare the
configure script just before you proceed with the above instructions:

   make -f Makefile.svn


Configuration
-------------

QXGEdit holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.config/rncbc.org/QXGEdit.conf . Normally, there's no
need to edit this file, as it is recreated and rewritten everytime
qxgedit is run.


Bugs
----

Plenty still, after all this is alpha software ;)


Support
-------

QXGEdit is open source free software. For bug reports, feature requests,
discussion forums, mailling lists, or any other matter related to the
development of this piece of software, please use the Sourceforge
project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/qxgedit).
