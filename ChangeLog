GIT HEAD

- Complete rewrite of Qt4 vs. Qt5 configure builds. (TESTING)

- A new top-level widget window geometry state save and restore
  sub-routine is now in effect. (EXPERIMENTAL)

- Added "Keywords" to desktop file; fix passing debian flags on
  configure (patches by Jaromír Mikeš, thanks).
- Fixed for some strict tests for Qt4 vs. Qt5 configure builds.

- Added application description as freedesktop.org's AppData.


0.2.0  2015-03-04  Fifth public release.

- In a glance, all GUI toolbox pages converted into tabs.

  View/Options.../Display/Widget style theme.

- Most graphics now rendered with anti-aliased lines.

- A man page has beed added.

- Allow the build system to include an user specified LDFLAGS.

- Fix port origin on MIDI RPN/NRPN 14-bit controllers input.


0.1.2  2013-12-31  A fifth of a Jubilee.

- A potential memory override crash-bug was flagged by gcc 4.8,
  on something like 'iteration 16u invokes undefined behavior
  [-Waggressive-loop-optimizations]' and then finally fixed.

- More preparations for Qt5 configure build.

- Primeval support for MIDI RPN/NRPN 14-bit controllers input.

- Fixed an incremental value stickiness, which were affecting
  some parameters step changes from up/down spin-box widgets
  (eg. Master Tune).

- Preparations for Qt5 migration.

- Skulpture style plugin is now deployed to a rather standard
  location on install (default: PREFIX/qt4/plugins/styles).

- Uservoice name preset drop-down list is now sorted.

- MIDI note names and their respective octave numbers are now
  compliant with the ISO standard where middle C (60) is now C4
  (was C3).

- Added include <unistd.h> to shut up gcc 4.7 build failures.

- Make(ing) -jN parallel builds now available for the masses.

- Updated to recent Skulpture style version 2.4.0.

- Fixed Makefile.in handling of installation directories to the
  configure script eg. --datadir.


0.1.1  2011-09-17  Third public release.

- Make sure Uservoice elements are selected only when available.

- Debugging stacktrace now applies to all working threads.

- libX11 is now being added explicitly to the build link phase,
  as seen necessary on some bleeding-edge distros eg. Fedora 13,
  Debian 6.

- Moving from old deprecated Qt3'ish custom event post handling
  into regular asynchronous signal/slot strategy.

- General standard dialog buttons layout is now in place.


0.1.0  2010-04-21  Second public release.

- Initial widget geometry and visibility persistence logic has
  been slightly revised as much to avoid crash failures due to
  wrong main widget hidden state.

- General source tree layout and build configuration change.

- Make build compilation work for gcc >= 4.4.0, by adding some
  missing standard C99 includes.

- LADISH Level 1 support has been added: SIGUSR1 signal trap
  just makes it a shortcut to File/Save.

- Uservoice (QS300) AmpEG Attack, Decay Level 1 and 2 parameters
  now have a bit cleaner, clearer out-of-the-box default values.

- Uservoice (QS300) preset combo-box drop-down list now gets its
  current item selection set alright.

- Global configuration state is now explicitly saved/committed to
  disk when Options dialog changes are accepted and applied.

- Variation part parameter is now a drop-down combo-box.

- New reset button for reverb, chorus and variation parameters.

- Randomization of all current vparameter values is now available,
  allowing for great experimentation and exploration of brand new
  sound settings (just try View/Randomize).

- All graphics lines are now slightly gray colored, instead of plain
  black or white, or whatever the current theme text color.

- Added user confirmation for QS300 user voice preset replacement;
  preset files are not deleted from file-system anymore.


0.0.1  2009-09-19  First public release.
